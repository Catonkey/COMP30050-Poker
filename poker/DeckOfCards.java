//Deck Of Cards class - represents a deck of standard playing cards. Has two arrays,
//one holds the cards in the deck, and the other holds cards returned by players to
//the discard pile (these cards cannot be dealt until the deck is reshuffled). The 
//integers 'next' and 'amountDiscarded' keep track of the positions of the next card
//to deal and the next empty space in the discard pile array. The dealNext and returnCard
//methods allow cards to be dealt and discarded. The reset method automatically shuffles a 
//reconstructed deck for a new game. Also contains a toString method and a main method for
//testing. When creating cards it is assumed that ace is high.
